"""Build the lurq icon font, with its grid-fitting hints, from the icons drawn in Pencil.

Reads:
  design/icons/svg/<name>.svg   one glyph each: a 24x24 viewBox of filled outlines, the SVG
                                export of the `Icon/<name>` component in pencil/lurq-design-system.pen
  design/icons/codepoints.json  name to codepoint in hex; a name keeps its codepoint for good

Writes:
  crates/lurq/assets/lurq-icons.ttf  the hinted font the toolkit embeds
  design/icons/codepoints.json       only to append a name it has not seen (from U+E000 up)
  crates/lurq/src/ui/icons.rs        the names and characters of the font, for `lurq::ui::Icon`
  design/icons/svg/<name>.svg        with --from-board: the glyphs that are new or redrawn

Run from the repository root (needs fontTools):

  python scripts/build-icon-font.py
  python scripts/build-icon-font.py --from-board
  python scripts/build-icon-font.py --unhinted target/lurq-icons-unhinted.ttf

The first form builds the font from the sources in the repository. The build is
deterministic: the same sources give the same bytes.

`--from-board` first brings the sources up to date with the Pencil file: every component
named `Icon/<name>` is exported as SVG, and a glyph that is new or drawn differently
replaces its source. A source whose component is gone from the board is kept and named in
the output, since its codepoint may be in use. A .pen file is encrypted on disk, so the
export goes through Pencil itself: the app has to be running, and the script starts its
MCP server and asks it. The server is the `mcp-server` executable in the app's resources:
`--pencil-mcp <path>`, or the PENCIL_MCP_SERVER variable, or the `pencil` server registered
with Claude Code in ~/.claude.json. `--board <file.pen>` reads another file.

`--unhinted` also writes the same outlines without instructions, to compare against.

The hinter works on one axis at a time. It finds the edges that run straight across the
axis (and the extrema of wide arcs), and pairs a low edge with the high edge across the
black as a stem. The program it writes for a glyph then, at each size:

- gives a stem one pixel while it is thin, and from there the width it was drawn with,
  one edge on the pixel grid: the edge that faces out of the glyph;
- draws a stem in whole pixels instead where the white beside it is too narrow to keep
  a whole pixel next to an edge off the grid;
- places stems from the middle of the glyph outward, and moves one further out when the
  white between it and the stem before it would not keep a whole pixel.

Diagonal strokes and free stroke ends stay unhinted. `prep` asks for native ClearType:
without it a smooth rasterizer ignores hints along x.
