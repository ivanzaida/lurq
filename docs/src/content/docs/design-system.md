# Design System

`lurq::ui` holds the design system's components and what a theme styles them with. It is being built a component at a time: this page describes what is in the crate today. The gallery (`cargo run -p gallery`) shows each component live.

```rust
use lurq::{components::Row, ui::{Button, ButtonVariant}};

Row::new()
  .spacing(8.0)
  .child(Button::new("Cancel").variant(ButtonVariant::Outline))
  .child(Button::new("Save").on_click(|_| save()))
```

A component is a builder that goes where an element goes. It takes the theme of the component being rendered around it, so nothing is passed to it, and what renders it renders again when the theme changes.

## The Three Layers

| Layer | What it says | Where it is set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tokens | What blue is, how round `Md` is | The palette and the scales of the [theme](../theme/) |
| Recipes | How each part of a component looks in each case | `theme.patch_recipe::<Button>(...)`, `theme.set_recipe::<Button>(...)` |
| Renderers | What nodes a component is built from | `theme.set_renderer::<Button>(...)`, `theme.set_part_renderer::<Button, _>(...)` |

Each has the design as its default. Most apps change tokens only. A brand changes recipes. A look whose controls are built differently changes renderers.

## Recipes

A component is made of named **parts**: a button has `Root`, `Label`, `Leading` and `Trailing`. A recipe is a list of rules, and a rule says that in a case a part has a style:

```rust
use lurq::{
  app::theme::{ControlSize, PaletteColor, RadiusSize},
  ui::{ButtonPart, ButtonVariant, Recipe, Selector},
};

let recipe = Recipe::new()
  // Always.
  .base(ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.height(ControlSize::Md).padding_x(16.0).radius(RadiusSize::Md))
  // For a variant.
  .variant(ButtonVariant::Primary, ButtonPart::Root, |s| {
    s.background(PaletteColor::Primary).foreground(PaletteColor::PrimaryForeground)
  })
  // For a variant under the pointer.
  .when(Selector::new().variant(ButtonVariant::Primary).hovered(), ButtonPart::Root, |s| {
    s.background(PaletteColor::PrimaryHover)
  });
```

| Rule | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `base(part, style)` | Always |
| `variant(variant, part, style)` | For a variant |
| `size(size, part, style)` | For a size |
| `density(density, part, style)` | While the theme is at a [density](../theme/#density) |
| `at(breakpoint, part, style)` | In a window at a [breakpoint](../theme/#breakpoints) or wider |
| `state(state, part, style)` | While the component is in a state: disabled, checked, loading |
| `hovered(part, style)`, `pressed(...)`, `focus_visible(...)` | Under the pointer, held down, focused from the keyboard |
| `when(selector, part, style)` | In the case a `Selector` describes: several of the above together |

- The rules that hold are laid one over another, the more specific over the less: always, then a variant, then a size, then a density, then a breakpoint (a wider one over a narrower), then states (more of them over fewer). Rules of one rank apply in the order they were written.
- A style a later rule sets replaces the earlier one's field by field; what it leaves alone shows through.
- Variants, sizes, states and parts are names. A component gives its own as enums, which are accepted where a name is, and an app adds any others: `.variant("brand", ...)`, `.state("pinned", ...)`.
- Rules for the pointer and the keyboard become [state styles](../styling-events/) of the node. A hover renders nothing again, and changes only what is painted: no size, padding or text.
- `Recipe::extend(&other)` adds another recipe's rules after this one's.

### Breakpoints

A rule `at(Breakpoint::Md, ...)` holds at that breakpoint and at every wider one; a rule with no breakpoint is for every width, the narrowest included. This is the order [`Responsive`](../theme/#responsive-values) values resolve in.

```rust
use lurq::{app::theme::Breakpoint, ui::{Button, ButtonPart}};

// A finger's button on a narrow window, the design's from the medium breakpoint up.
theme.patch_recipe::<Button>(|rules| {
  rules
    .base(ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.height(48.0))
    .at(Breakpoint::Md, ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.height(36.0))
});
```

A component is built again when the window's width crosses a breakpoint, not at every resize. `ui::current_breakpoint()` is the breakpoint of the window what is being built is in.

### Density

A theme is at one [density](../theme/#density), and a rule `density(Density::Compact, ...)` holds while it is at that one. A component is resolved at the density of the theme it is built in, and is built again when `theme.set_density(..)` changes it.

```rust
use lurq::{app::theme::Density, ui::{Button, ButtonPart}};

// A theme whose buttons are as high as a row is: lower in a compact tool, higher under a finger.
theme.patch_recipe::<Button>(|rules| {
  rules
    .density(Density::Compact, ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.height(Density::Compact))
    .density(Density::Touch, ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.height(Density::Touch))
});
theme.set_density(Density::Compact);
```

The design's recipe for `Button` has no rule for a density: a button has its sizes. `Selector::density(..)` joins a density with a variant, a size or a state in one rule.

## Part Styles

`PartStyle` is the style of one part: a patch in which every field is optional. Every component uses this one type.

| Builder | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| `background(color)`, `foreground(color)` | The fill, and the color of the text and icons in the part and under it |
| `border(border)`, `radius(radius)` | A border on every side; the corners |
| `shadow(shadow)`, `veil(color)` | Shadows; a color laid over the fill and under the content (`StateHover`, `StatePressed`) |
| `outline(outline)`, `focus_ring()` | An outline; the theme's focus ring as the outline |
| `opacity(value)` | A number, or a level of the theme's (`OpacityLevel::Disabled`) |
| `padding_x(spacing)`, `padding_y(spacing)`, `gap(spacing)` | Padding, and the room between the part's children |
| `width(length)`, `height(length)`, `min_width(length)`, `square(length)` | A `Length`: pixels, a step of the control, density or icon scale, `Length::Fill` |
| `typography(role)` | Every field of the part's text at once |
| `font_family(family)`, `font_size(px)`, `weight(weight)`, `font_style(style)`, `line_height(ratio)`, `letter_spacing(px)` | One field of the text, over the role's |
| `transition(PartTransition::new(Transition::background_color(), MotionDuration::Fast))` | A transition, with a duration and an easing of the theme's |
| `cursor(icon)` | The cursor over the part |

Colors, radii, spacings and shadows are roles of the theme or concrete values, as everywhere in lurq.

A part's text is in one of the theme's two families or in one by name:

```rust
use lurq::ui::{ButtonPart, FontFamily};

rules
  .base(ButtonPart::Label, |s| s.font_family("Georgia"))
  .variant("code", ButtonPart::Label, |s| s.font_family(FontFamily::Mono))
```

## What A Theme Changes

```rust
use lurq::{app::theme::RadiusSize, ui::{Button, ButtonPart, ButtonVariant}};

// Every primary button is a pill.
app.theme().patch_recipe::<Button>(|rules| {
  rules.variant(ButtonVariant::Primary, ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.radius(RadiusSize::Full))
});
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `theme.patch_recipe::<C>(\|rules\| ...)` | Lays rules over the component's recipe. What it adds wins where both style a case. |
| `theme.set_recipe::<C>(recipe)` | Gives the component a recipe in place of the design's: nothing of the design's is left under it. |
| `theme.set_renderer::<C>(renderer)` | Builds other nodes for the same behavior. |
| `theme.set_part_renderer::<C, R>(part, renderer)` | Builds one part; the rest is still built by the renderer it had. |

The same is on a [`ThemeDefinition`](../theme/#themes-as-one-value), in its `ui` field: `definition.ui.patch::<Button>(...)`, `set_recipe`, `set_renderer`, `set_part_renderer`, `reset_recipe`.

What a theme resolved for a component in a case it keeps until the theme changes, so a list of a thousand buttons resolves the recipe once.

### A Bare Theme

`ThemeDefinition::bare()` has the design's tokens and no recipe. Every part of every component comes out unstyled, and every component still works: a bare button is its label, pressed by a click and by the keyboard. It is the base for a look that shares nothing with the design's.

```rust
use lurq::{
  app::theme::{RadiusSize, ThemeDefinition},
  node::color::Color,
  ui::{Button, ButtonPart, Recipe},
};

let mut look = ThemeDefinition::bare();
look.ui.set_recipe::<Button>(
  Recipe::new()
    .base(ButtonPart::Root, |s| {
      s.height(44.0)
        .padding_x(24.0)
        .radius(RadiusSize::Full)
        .background(Color::from_hex("#111827"))
        .foreground(Color::from_hex("#f9fafb"))
    })
    .hovered(ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.background(Color::from_hex("#374151"))),
);
app.theme().apply(look);
```

### Renderers

A recipe restyles a component and cannot change what it is made of. A renderer builds its nodes. It is given the component's view: what the component was given, the style of each of its parts, and its behavior ready to be dressed.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use lurq::{components::{Column, Rect}, ui::{Button, ButtonPart, ButtonRenderer, ButtonView}};

// A button whose label is in capitals with a bar under it.
let renderer: ButtonRenderer = Arc::new(|view: ButtonView| {
  let label = view.part(ButtonPart::Label).text(&view.label.to_uppercase());
  view.root().child(Column::new().child(label).child(Rect::new(20.0, 2.0))).into()
});
app.theme().set_renderer::<Button>(renderer);
```

- `view.root()` is the element that is pressed, focused and disabled, with the style of the root part and nothing in it yet. The behavior is lurq's: a renderer cannot leave it out.
- `view.part(part)` is the style of a part; `.part(&style)` on any element gives the element that style, and `style.text("...")` is a text in the part's typography.
- A renderer for one part leaves the rest to the renderer the component had:

```rust
use lurq::ui::ButtonPartRenderer;

let label: ButtonPartRenderer = Arc::new(|view| view.part(ButtonPart::Label).text(&format!("» {}", view.label)).into());
app.theme().set_part_renderer::<Button, ButtonPartRenderer>(ButtonPart::Label, label);
```

### One Instance, One Place, One Subtree

```rust
// One instance, over what the theme gives it.
Button::new("Wide").style(ButtonPart::Root, |s| s.padding_x(40.0));

// The buttons in the places of a component: what a message box says of its confirm button.
let confirm = Recipe::new().base(ButtonPart::Label, |s| s.font_family("Georgia"));
Button::new("Confirm").rules(&confirm);

// A subtree in a theme of its own: a dense inspector in a window that is not.
let inspector = ctx.in_theme(&dense, |ctx| inspector_panel(ctx));
```

- The order, later over earlier: the theme's recipe, the rules of the place (`.rules(...)`), the instance's own (`.style(...)`).
- `ctx.in_theme(&theme, |ctx| ...)` is the theme of everything the closure builds and mounts. Components mounted in it keep the theme when they render again on their own.
- `ui::current_theme()` is the theme of what is being built. Outside a render there is none, and it is a neutral one that follows nothing: build components where they are rendered.

## Button

An action a press starts: a click, or Enter or Space while it is focused.

```rust
use lurq::ui::{Button, ButtonSize, ButtonVariant};

Button::new("Delete")
  .variant(ButtonVariant::Destructive)
  .size(ButtonSize::Sm)
  .on_click(|_| delete());
```

| Builder | |
| --- | --- |
| `variant(variant)` | `Primary` (the default), `Secondary`, `Outline`, `Ghost`, `Destructive`, or a variant the theme's recipe names |
| `size(size)` | `Sm` 32, `Md` 36 (the default), `Lg` 40: the steps of the theme's control sizes; or a size the recipe names |
| `leading(element)`, `trailing(element)` | An element before and after the label: an icon |
| `disabled(bool)` | It takes no input: no press, hover or focus, and Tab passes it by. It is dimmed to the theme's `OpacityLevel::Disabled` |
| `full_width(bool)` | As wide as what it is in |
| `on_click(handler)` | A click, and Enter and Space while it is focused |
| `state(name, on)` | A state the theme's recipe names |
| `style(part, \|s\| ...)`, `rules(&recipe)` | One instance over the theme; the rules of the place it is in |
| `force(Some(Interaction::Hovered))` | Drawn hovered, pressed or focused with nothing pointing at it: for a gallery, a screenshot, a test |
| `id(id)`, `key(key)`, `submit()` | Its id and key; with the `form` feature, the button that submits the form it is in |

| Part | |
| --- | --- |
| `ButtonPart::Root` | The button itself: its fill, size, padding, corners, focus ring |
| `ButtonPart::Label` | Its text: 13/500 in the design |
| `ButtonPart::Leading`, `ButtonPart::Trailing` | What is before and after the label |

States a recipe styles: `ButtonState::Disabled`, `ButtonState::FullWidth`, and hovered, pressed and focus-visible.

In the design a button under the pointer has its variant's hover fill (`PrimaryHover`, `SecondaryHover`, `DestructiveHover`, and `Highlight` for an outline or a ghost button), a button held down has the `StatePressed` veil over that, and one focused from the keyboard has the theme's focus ring.

## A Component Of Your Own

A component of an app is themed the same way when it implements `Themed`: a name the theme keeps its recipe under, the type of its renderer, and its recipe when the theme says nothing about it.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use lurq::{node::Element, ui::{Case, Recipe, Themed, current_theme}};

struct Tile;

impl Themed for Tile {
  const NAME: &'static str = "tile";
  type Renderer = Arc<dyn Fn(&str) -> Element + Send + Sync>;

  fn recipe() -> Recipe {
    Recipe::new().base("root", |s| s.padding_x(16.0).padding_y(12.0))
  }
}

fn tile(title: &str) -> Element {
  let theme = current_theme();
  let recipe = theme.resolve::<Tile>(&Case::new(), None);
  let root = recipe.part("root");
  lurq::components::Column::new().part(&root).child(root.text(title)).into()
}
```

`theme.patch_recipe::<Tile>(...)`, `set_recipe`, a bare theme and `in_theme` then reach it as they reach lurq's own.
