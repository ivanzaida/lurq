# App Runtime

The public runtime surface is split between `App`, `Tree`, and the shell.

## App

`App` stores services shared by a tree pass:

- glyph engine and loaded fonts,
- theme,
- profiling enabled flag,
- optional scale override,
- optional resource loader and decoded image/SVG caches.

```rust
let mut app = lurq::app::App::new();

app.load_font_file(std::path::Path::new("assets/Inter.ttf"));
app.register_font("ui", "Inter");
app.set_profiling_enabled(true);

#[cfg(feature = "resources")]
app.set_resource_root(std::path::PathBuf::from("assets"));
```

## Tree

`Tree` stores the retained UI state. It owns:

- root component or static root element,
- component contexts and reactive subscriptions,
- retained nodes,
- layout state and layout cache,
- render engine instance and render engine factory,
- input state,
- animation and transition engines,
- perf overlay state,
- secondary windows and optional DevTools metadata.

```rust
let mut tree = lurq::app::Tree::new();
tree.mount_root::<RootComponent>(&mut app, RootProps::default());
```

For static UI without a component root:

```rust
tree.set_root(lurq::components::Text::new("Hello"));
```

## Render Engine Factory

Use a factory, not a prebuilt render engine. Secondary windows, including DevTools, can inherit the same renderer choice by asking the factory for their own engine instance.

```rust
tree.set_render_engine_factory(|| {
  Box::new(lurq::app::wgpu_render::WgpuRenderEngine::new())
});
```

On Windows with `dx12`:

```rust
tree.set_render_engine_factory(|| {
  Box::new(lurq::app::dx12_render::Dx12RenderEngine::new())
});
```

## Winit Shell

`WinitWindow` creates the OS window, forwards events to `Tree`, and calls `Tree::pass`.

```rust
WinitWindow::new(app, tree)
  .with_title("lurq app")
  .with_size(1200, 800)
  .with_min_size(800, 500)
  .with_title_bar_color(lurq::node::color::Color::from_hex("#101215"))
  .with_icon(lurq::app::WindowIcon::from_rgba(vec![255, 0, 0, 255], 1, 1))
  .with_corner_radius(lurq::app::WindowCornerRadius::RoundedSmall)
  .with_decorations(false)
  .run();
```

The shell runs a steady redraw tick automatically. Use `on_tick` only for custom per-frame app work.

Runtime window commands requested through `ctx.window()` are applied by the winit shell. This includes closing, minimizing, fullscreen toggles, decoration toggles, native title bar color, native corner radius, window icon, moving, resizing, and native platform window drag or resize requests for custom chrome. `start_drag()` asks the shell to begin an OS-level window move, and `start_resize(direction)` asks it to begin an OS-level edge or corner resize. `stop_drag()` is available for portable shells that track drag state manually.

## Frame And Redraw Flow

`Tree` sets `needs_redraw` when state changes:

- signal/store/memo dependency updates,
- input, hover, active, focus, scroll, drag, or cursor changes,
- animation or transition progress,
- layout-affecting ref mutation,
- perf overlay updates,
- DevTools pick/overlay state.

The shell observes `needs_redraw`, requests a redraw, then calls `Tree::pass(app, window)`.

`Tree::pass(...)` returns a `PassReport` describing whether the pass was required, whether it rendered, whether it reused a cached render list, whether layout updated or recalculated, and which runtime reasons contributed to the pass. `WinitWindow::on_paint` receives the same report after a presented frame:

```rust
WinitWindow::new(app, tree)
  .on_paint(|tree, delta, report| {
    if report.layout_recalculated {
      eprintln!("layout recalculated after {:?}", delta);
    }

    let _ = tree.frame_count();
  })
  .run();
```

## Input Dispatch

Pointer input is resolved against the latest layout and hit-tested in visual coordinates. The runtime tracks hover, active, focus, drag, scroll, cursor, text selection, and text click counts across retained nodes. Mouse handlers run before pointer defaults such as input focus, text selection, form submit, and outside-click overlay dismissal, so handlers can call `event.prevent_default()` to block those defaults.

User keyboard handlers run before built-in keyboard defaults. Built-in text behavior handles caret movement, selection replacement, undo/redo, and clipboard shortcuts when the `clipboard` feature is enabled. Call `event.prevent_default()` from an `on_key_down` handler to block those built-in defaults for that key. `TextInput::on_input` runs inside the text-edit default, before the edit is applied, and can mutate the input signal or prevent that edit. Scroll handlers also run before default scroll movement.

## Sizing And Scale

The shell updates the tree from the window before each pass:

```rust
tree.set_scale_factor(window.scale_factor() as f32);
tree.resize(size.width, size.height);
```

Tests can override layout constraints directly:

```rust
tree.set_layout_constraints_override(Some(lurq::layout::Constraints::tight(
  lurq::layout::Size::new(800.0, 600.0),
)));
```

## Element Lookup

Use `find_element` when integration code or tests need a computed rect.

```rust
let found = tree.find_element(|el| el.text_content() == Some("Save"));

if let Some(found) = found {
  let bounds = found.bounds();
  println!("{}x{} at {}, {}", bounds.width, bounds.height, bounds.x, bounds.y);
}
```

Use `find_element_mut` only for imperative layout overrides. Declarative component state is the normal path.

Nodes tagged with `.id("...")` / `.class("...")` support browser-style lookup, mutation, and typed interaction:

```rust
let save = tree.get_element_by_id("save");                 // first match in tree order
let rows = tree.get_elements_by_class_name("row");         // all matches in tree order

let mut handle = tree.get_element_by_id_mut("save").unwrap();
handle.click();                                            // DOM el.click() semantics
handle.set_background("#ef4444");                          // transient direct mutation

tree.get_element_by_id_mut("email").unwrap()
  .as_text_input().unwrap()
  .set_value("ada@example.com");                           // signal-backed, no on_input
```

See [Retained Nodes](./retained_nodes/#ids-and-classes) for the full contract (transiency, duplicate ids, pre-layout behavior).

## Perf Overlay

The runtime has a built-in frame perf overlay.

```rust
tree.draw_perf_overlay();
```

Profiling data is available through:

```rust
let profile = tree.last_profile();
```

The profile records high-level timings such as layout, resolve, glyph, upload, encode, submit, present, and memory counters used by DevTools.

## Performance Notes

Current text-page scroll profiles show that baked transformed text no longer spends frame time reshaping text after `GlyphEngine` hits `transformed_glyph_layout_cache`. The remaining CPU target is transformed glyph atlas lookup and packing in `GlyphEngine::get_or_pack_transformed_glyph`, with occasional normal text cache misses when newly visible text enters the viewport.

The next optimization pass should reduce per-frame transformed glyph work. Likely directions are caching transformed glyph command templates per stable text layout and transform, or tracking visible text runs so scroll frames mostly update origins and clips instead of visiting every transformed glyph through the atlas path.

## DevTools Window

With `devtools` enabled:

```rust
lurq::app::devtools::load_fonts(&mut app);
app.set_profiling_enabled(true);
tree.mount_devtools(&mut app);
```

DevTools is represented as a secondary tree. The shell does not need special inspector logic; it only manages secondary windows and renders each tree.
