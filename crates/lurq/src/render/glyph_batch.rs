//! Glyph runs a renderer draws with one instanced draw.
//!
//! A render list's glyphs come as runs: the glyphs of one text, with one
//! paint order and one clip. Texts that follow one another in paint order
//! with nothing else painted between them lie one after another in the list,
//! and one instanced draw over several of them paints the same instances in
//! the same order as a draw per text. Two kinds of runs may share a draw:
//!
//! - runs under the same clip, drawn with that clip as before;
//! - in the window, runs whose clips cut nothing off them (`GlyphRun::spared`), whatever the clips are: drawn without a
//!   clip, they paint the same pixels. Most text is like this: a label inside its row, a message inside the list's
//!   viewport.
//!
//! So a list of labels is a draw or two instead of one per label, with the
//! same pixels.
// Only the GPU renderers batch; `render` alone (Canvas) builds this unused.
