//! What the code that mounts a component puts on the root of the element
//! `mount` returns: an `id`, classes or a `key` (`Ctx::mount::<C>(props).id("x")`),
//! and what a wrapper such as `Draggable` puts on the root of the child it is
//! given (`Element::decorate_root`).
//!
//! The component's root node holds them in the mounting component's rendered
//! tree, but the component's own render knows nothing of them. When the
//! component renders again by itself (a dirty refresh, which does not render
//! the mounting component again), its fresh root replaces the decorated one in
//! the live tree and in the cached trees of the components above it; the root
//! being replaced hands its decoration to the fresh one there, so a lookup by
//! the outer id still finds the component.
