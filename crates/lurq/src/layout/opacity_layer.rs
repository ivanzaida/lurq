//! Flattened group opacity and layer blur.
//!
//! A node with `opacity < 1` fades its subtree as one flattened layer, like
//! CSS `opacity` and design tools: the subtree is painted into an offscreen
//! layer, which is then composited once at the node's opacity. Content inside
//! the group blends only with other content of the group, so a label over a
//! faded fill keeps its contrast against that fill, and a border drawn over
//! the fill's anti-aliased edge does not leave a lighter ring.
//!
//! A node with a blur is a layer too, like CSS `filter: blur()`: its subtree
//! is painted into the layer, and the layer is blurred as it is composited
//! ([`LayerBlur`]). A blurred layer is painted for more pixels than it shows,
//! because what lies just outside the visible part still bleeds into it. The
//! radius is in the node's own units: under a transform that scales the node
//! it scales with it.
//!
//! Layout records each group as a range of quads (`OpacityGroup`). A faded
//! group whose content paints a single primitive gives the same pixels either
//! way, so layout folds its opacity into that quad instead and no layer is
//! made. The runtime turns the remaining groups into [`LayerCmd`]s with pixel
//! bounds, and render engines walk a `LayerPlan` to paint each layer into
//! its own target before compositing it into its parent.
