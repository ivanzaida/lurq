//! Opacity groups. A node with `opacity < 1` fades its subtree as one layer
//! (see [`crate::layout::opacity_layer`]): its quads, its children's and its
//! overlay quads are emitted at full opacity and recorded as a group. A group
//! that paints one primitive folds its opacity into that quad instead, which
//! paints the same pixels without a layer.
//!
//! A node with a blur is a group as well, and always a layer: the blur is
//! applied to the layer as it is composited.
