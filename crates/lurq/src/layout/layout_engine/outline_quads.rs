//! Paint of a node's outline: a ring around its box, drawn over its content
//! and over what is painted after the node.
//!
//! Of two buttons side by side, the second is painted after the first: a ring
//! painted with the first would be covered where it lies over the second. So
//! a node's outline is kept (`pending_outlines`) and painted at the end of
//! the scope the node is in, over everything in that scope:
//!
//! - a scroll container, whose border and bars are over what scrolls;
//! - an element with an opacity or a blur, which is painted as one layer;
//! - the siblings that scroll under an element that sticks;
//! - the page, and each layer over it: a menu, a dialog;
//! - failing these, the tree.
//!
//! Containers clip their content to their bounds by default, and a control
//! often fills its container to the edge: clipped as content is, its ring
//! would be cut there, on every side it touches. So an outline takes the clip
//! its node is under let out by how far the outline reaches. A node that is
//! itself cut by a container is still cut with its ring, a little further
//! out. A scroll viewport, and the window, cut the ring where they cut the
//! node: what scrolls out of view takes its ring with it.
