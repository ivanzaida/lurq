//! A finger as the tree sees it: its own events, and the pointer it stands for.
//!
//! **Touch events.** Every finger sends `on_touch_start`, `on_touch_move`, `on_touch_end` and `on_touch_cancel`
//! to what it landed on ([`Tree::touch_event`]), and one that rests sends `on_long_press`
//! ([`Tree::touch_long_press`]).
//!
//! **Gestures.** Two fingers on one element that listens for them pinch (`on_pinch`) and rotate
//! (`on_rotate`): each is told from the other, and from two fingers that only rest or scroll, once the fingers
//! moved apart or turned by more than a slop. From then on the two fingers are the gesture's, and
//! [`Tree::touch_event`] says so, for the shell to stop treating one of them as the pointer.
//!
//! The fingers that are down together, from the first to land until the last lifts, are also told as a whole
//! ([`Session`]): a tap of however many fingers (`on_tap`), their travel while it lasts (`on_pan`), a flick
//! when they lift (`on_swipe`), and one finger coming in from an edge of the window (`on_edge_pan`), which
//! from the left edge goes back in the history as a phone does, and from the right edge forward.
//!
//! **The pointer.** A touch shell gives the first finger to the tree as the pointer through the methods here
//! rather than through the mouse's, because a finger is not a mouse in three ways a list of the platform shows:
//!
//! - it hovers nothing. The mouse events still come, `on_mouse_enter` and `on_mouse_leave` among them, but no element
//!   takes its hovered style from a finger;
//! - a tap clicks when the finger lifts, and what it tapped stays pressed for a moment after, so that a tap quicker
//!   than a frame still shows;
//! - what a finger holds stays pressed only while the finger is near it. Moved further than [`PRESS_REACH`] from it,
//!   the element no longer shows as pressed, and shows so again when the finger comes back; lifted within that reach,
//!   even beside the element, the finger clicks it.
