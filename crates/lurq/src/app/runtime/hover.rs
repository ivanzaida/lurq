//! Hover under a pointer that holds still. A scroll, a list that grows or any
//! other relayout moves content under the pointer without a mouse event, so
//! after each layout the hover is hit-tested again at the pointer's last
//! position, like the web does: the node that moved away gets its
//! `on_mouse_leave` (and with it, its tooltip goes), the node that moved under
//! the pointer its `on_mouse_enter`. They run with the source of the input
//! that last put the pointer there, so an agent's pointer stays synthetic.
//!
//! A hover style that moves its own node away from the pointer (a `hovered`
//! size or offset with a transition) unhovers it, which moves it back under
//! the pointer, and so on: like CSS `:hover`, such a node flickers.
//!
//! A hover that shows nothing asks for no frame. The hover moves whenever the
//! pointer comes onto another node, a text inside its row say, and most nodes
//! look the same under the pointer: a frame for each of those moves draws the
//! pixels of the frame before it. One is asked for when a node that gained or
//! lost the hover is drawn differently for it or ran a handler for it (see
//! [`set_hover`]), and for every change while DevTools shows the tree.
