//! What a touch shell asks of the tree: what a finger that lands on a point does, the scroll of a finger's
//! gesture, and the stretch of a list pulled past its end.
//!
//! A scroll container whose content is larger than its viewport gives when a finger pulls it past an end: the
//! content follows the finger, less and less the further it is pulled ([`rubber`]), and springs back when the
//! finger lifts. Momentum that reaches an end carries the content past it and the same spring brings it back.
//! Both are a scroll view of the platform's: `UIScrollView` on iOS.
