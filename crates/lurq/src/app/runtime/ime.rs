//! Input method (IME) composition for the focused `TextInput`.
//!
//! A shell forwards the platform's input method events through
//! [`Tree::ime`]; the winit shell does so on Windows and macOS alike. A
//! composition is shown in the focused input (see
//! `node_kind::text_input_composition`) until the input method commits it,
//! which inserts the text like typing.
//!
//! The keys of a composition belong to the input method. Windows reports each
//! key it takes as a press of `Process`, the Enter that confirms a composition
//! included, before the commit; macOS reports none of them, only the release
//! of the key that confirmed. A press of `Process` is withheld from handlers
//! and defaults. Any other press is delivered as usual, marked `composing`
//! while a composition is shown (lurq's own defaults ignore such an `Enter`),
//! so a key the input method passes on (a space after a Korean syllable) is
//! never lost and a composition the platform never ends cannot hold keys back.
//! The releases of withheld presses, of `Process`, of keys while composing and
//! of the key that confirmed a commit reach `on_key_up` handlers marked
//! `composing`.
