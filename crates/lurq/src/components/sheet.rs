//! A sheet: content that comes up from the bottom of the window over everything in it, as a phone's apps
//! show a choice or a short task.
//!
//! - It comes up when its signal is set, and goes down when the signal is cleared, by Escape, by a tap beside it, or by
//!   a finger that drags it down far enough or fast enough.
//! - It stands at one of its [`SheetDetent`]s, and a finger moves it between them.
//! - Content that scrolls, named with [`SheetProps::scroll`], scrolls under a finger once the sheet is at its highest
//!   and gives the finger to the sheet when it is at its top.
